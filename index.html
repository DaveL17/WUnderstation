        <h3>Installation</h3>
            <img class="TextWrap" src="pluginConfigDialog.png">
            <p>Installation is easy. Download and extract the Indigo Plugin file onto your Indigo server machine. Double-click the plugin file and follow the prompts. Presently, the
                plugin does not make use of any Indigo devices; all controls and data sources are managed through the plugin configuration dialog. The plugin supports only one PWS location at a time; the operation of the plugin is very simple.
                <ol>
                <li>Within the plugin preferences, enter the PWS information and password for your PWS account.
                <li>Enter the frequency of updates (in seconds)
                <li>Select the data sources that you want to use for each Weather Underground data element--there are about 50 to choose from.
                </ol>
            <p>It is important to note that <strong><em>you are responsible for the data you upload to Weather Underground</em></strong>. For example, it's possible that you could report the brightness of a
                light as the outside temperature. So be careful and choose wisely.</p>
