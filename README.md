The WUnderstation Plugin for the Indigo Home Control Server (Indigo) is 
used to provide a bridge between Indigo and the Weather Underground 
Personal Weather Station network data system.

**Note:** The WUnderstation plugin requires access to the Internet in order 
to send data to your PWS account on the Weather Underground servers.
