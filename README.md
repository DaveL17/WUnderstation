The WUnderstation Plugin for the Indigo Home Control Server (Indigo) is 
used to provide a bridge between Indigo and the Weather Underground 
Personal Weather Station network data system.

Note: The WUnderstation plugin requires Internet access to send data 
to your PWS account on the Weather Underground servers. The plugin 
also requires Internet access in order to check for plugin software 
updates.
